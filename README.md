# Early_Disease_Monitoring_System
This project aims to collect data from local hospitals like number of patients admitted per day. It the aims to find breakout of infectious diseases in different locations using the data on hospitalizations.

The software collects data from all hospitals across India about patient disease trends (data about - symptoms, diagnosis, date of admittance, result of treatment and date of each patient. The software will then show the density of hospitalizations for different diseases across India. This data can be used to predict breakout of epidemics spread across a larger area using the data from hospitalizations. COVID-19 has symptoms quite similar to normal flu and cold and is quite hard to distinguish. However around 20% of these cases are severe and require hospitalization. Due to the high infectivity of diseases like COVID-19 they cause an overburdening of the hospital system and causes its collapse which leads to even more people dying like what has happened in Italy, Spain and Iran. Making a system which is sensitive enough to detect small or gradual increase in Hospital load will help in pointing out such disease outbreaks in the future and thereby containing such diseases and preventing people from dying by taking strong and appropriate Early measures
